        -- Exercise : 

        In this exercise we will implements the cart for a user.


        - Step 1 :
	        Create a table name 'product' in your database.
	        This table have the following attributs : id, name, description, price, picture, and category.
	        Category can be whatever you want, example : Clothes, Sport, Computer, Headphones.....

		- Step 2 :
			Create a nav/menu with at least one element : cart
			It should look like this : cart(x)
			x will be the number of products in your cart.

 		- Step 3 :
	        Create a page 'products.php'.
	        This page will display all the products, with the picture first, then name, category and price.
	        On every product, add a button 'Add to cart'.

        - Step 4 :
	        Create an AJAX call that sends informations about the product to add the product to the cart.
	        So you should have a second file named 'addToCart.php'
	        This file will take informations about a product and add this product to cart.

        - Step 4 :
	        When you click on the button 'add to cart', make the AJAX call.

        - Step 5 :
	        When the product is add, update the cart item of your nav/menu


        - Step 6(bonus) : 
			You can go further if you want and add a nice style to the cart (to see price and so on).
